# Media Asset Tracker - Implementation Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the Media Asset Tracker system, combining metadata tracking with a physical organization system using QR codes. This solution follows your GraetzMedia workflow guidelines while addressing your specific needs for managing terabytes of media across many drives.

## System Overview

The Media Asset Tracker consists of two interconnected components:

1. **Digital Asset Catalog**: A database that tracks all files across your storage drives
2. **Physical Tracking System**: QR code labels for drives and shelves with check-in/check-out functionality

## Key Features

### Metadata Tracking
- Automatically catalog all files on a drive (including metadata extraction from media files)
- Searchable database of all assets
- Project-based organization
- File checksums for verification

### Physical Organization
- QR-coded labels for drives and shelf positions
- NIIMBOT printer integration
- Check-out/check-in system for tracking drive movements
- Mobile interface for quick scanning and lookups

## Storage Approaches

Based on your hardware setup, we recommend:

### For Ubuntu Systems (PC with RTX 4090 or other Ubuntu machine)
- Host the main database and web interface
- Use the 10gbE network for fast access
- Connect the SATA dock for cataloging drives

### For Mac Studio/MacBook
- Use as scanning/cataloging stations
- Access the web interface for searching and management
- Direct NIIMBOT printer integration (if using macOS)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core System Setup
1. Create repository structure following GraetzMedia workflow
2. Implement database and drive scanning modules
3. Develop CLI interface for basic operations
4. Set up initial web interface
5. Create QR code generation system

### Phase 2: Physical Organization
1. Design shelving system with bay/shelf/position labeling
2. Implement location management in database
3. Create physical labels for shelves
4. Develop check-in/check-out functionality
5. Connect with NIIMBOT printer

### Phase 3: Web and Mobile Interface
1. Complete web interface with search, browsing, and management
2. Develop mobile-friendly interface for scanning QR codes
3. Implement project management features
4. Add reporting and statistics
5. Set up Docker for containerization

## Work Pipeline Example

Here's how the system would work in a typical scenario:

1. **Archive Phase**
   - Project is completed and ready for archiving
   - Connect drive to cataloging station
   - Run `media-asset-tracker catalog /path/to/drive -l "ClientX_ProjectY_2023"`
   - System scans all files and generates QR code
   - Print QR labels for drive and shelf position
   - Place drive in designated location and affix labels

2. **Retrieval Phase**
   - Client requests footage from old project
   - Search system: `media-asset-tracker search "interview-client-x"`
   - System shows file is on drive "ClientX_ProjectY_2023" at location "B2-S3-P5"
   - Scan shelf QR code to confirm location
   - Check out drive from system
   - Connect drive and access files
   - Return drive and check it back in

## User Interfaces

The system includes:

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For quick operations and scripting
2. **Web Interface**: For browsing, searching, and management
3. **Mobile Interface**: For scanning QR codes and checking drives in/out

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (available on both macOS and Ubuntu)
- Flask for web interface
- SQLite for database
- QR code libraries
- NIIMBOT printer utilities
- Docker for containerization (optional)
- ffmpeg/ffprobe for media metadata extraction (optional)

## Additional Customizations

Based on your specific workflow:

- **RED/Canon Focus**: Extra metadata extraction for RED and Canon camera files
- **Motion Control Integration**: Tags for footage from your camBLOCK, Kessler, and Axibo rigs
- **Client Classification**: Organization system that prioritizes frequent clients
- **Shelf Design**: Optimized for your specific drive cases and space constraints

## Next Steps

1. Review this implementation plan
2. Let Claude Code create the repository structure
3. Implement core modules with Claude Code's assistance
4. Set up physical shelving system
5. Begin cataloging your existing drives

This approach gives you a complete system for both digital and physical asset management, following your workflow guidelines while addressing the specific challenges of media production archive management.

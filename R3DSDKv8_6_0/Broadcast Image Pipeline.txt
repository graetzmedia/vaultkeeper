The Broadcast Image Pipeline (ColorVersionBC) introduced in R3D SDK 8.6.0 is available for all R3D
clips shot in broadcast mode in-camera. Such clips can also be switched to IPP2 (ColorVersion3).

The following ImageProcessingSettings structure fields are supported, all others are ignored:
	- Kelvin
	- Tint
	- ISO
	- GammaCurve, limited to ImageGammaBT1886 & ImageGammaHDR2084
	- ColorSpace, limited to ImageColorRec709 & ColorVersionBC
	- ChromaNoiseReduction
	- FlashingPixelAdjustment
	- ExposureAdjust
	- MasklineAdjust

Non-broadcast clips cannot be decoded with the Broadcast Image Pipeline and will automatically be
switched to IPP2 to help in situations where pipeline setting might be per project etc. in applications.

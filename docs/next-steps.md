# VaultKeeper: Next Steps

This document outlines the recommended next steps for developing VaultKeeper, including features to implement, components to test, and integration considerations.

## 1. Immediate Priority Tasks

### Testing Core Functionality
- Test database initialization and schema
- Verify drive scanning and metadata extraction
- Test QR code generation and printing with NIIMBOT printers
- Validate drive health checking functionality

### Basic Setup and Configuration
- Complete the `install.sh` script testing
- Set up udev rules for NIIMBOT printers and QR scanner
- Test drive detection with the Orico 5-bay dock

## 2. RED SDK Integration

### Phase 1: Basic R3D Support (Without SDK)
- Enhance file detection to identify R3D files from RED cameras
- Extract basic metadata using ffmpeg where possible
- Generate thumbnails from R3D files using ffmpeg as a fallback
- Store RED-specific flags in the database for later enhancement

### Phase 2: Full RED SDK Integration
- Create a C++ wrapper library for the RED SDK with these functions:
  ```cpp
  bool init_red_sdk(const char* lib_path);
  void finalize_red_sdk();
  bool generate_r3d_thumbnail(const char* input_path, const char* output_path, float frame_pos);
  char* extract_r3d_metadata(const char* input_path);
  ```

- Build a Python interface using ctypes or pybind11
- Update the thumbnail generation system to use the SDK for R3D files
- Extract enhanced metadata specific to RED cameras

### Integration Considerations
- Make RED SDK support optional with clear fallback paths
- Handle the proprietary nature of the RED SDK by keeping wrapper code separate
- Document the setup process for users who want R3D support
- Ensure robust error handling for SDK initialization failures

## 3. GUI Development (Optional)

If a graphical interface is desired beyond CLI:

- Create a minimal GTK-based GUI focused on:
  - Thumbnail browsing and viewing
  - Searching the database
  - Displaying drive health reports
  - Managing shelf locations
  
- Keep the GUI as a thin wrapper around the core functionality
- Avoid any web-based interfaces or port allocations

## 4. Documentation

Expand the documentation in these areas:

- Complete user guide with workflow examples
- Hardware setup instructions (NIIMBOT printers, Eyoyo scanner, Orico dock)
- Detailed CLI reference for all commands
- System maintenance and backup procedures

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Create automated tests for core functionality
- Test with real drives, especially those containing RED footage
- Stress test with large drives (8TB+) and many files
- Verify scanning performance and optimization

## 6. Deployment and Distribution

- Create a release packaging script
- Test installation on fresh Ubuntu systems
- Document system requirements and dependencies
- Create upgrade path for future versions

## 7. Optional Enhancements

### Performance Improvements
- Implement parallel processing for drive scanning
- Optimize database queries for large collections
- Add caching for frequently accessed thumbnails

### Additional Features
- Add report generation for drive contents
- Implement timeline view for related footage
- Create calendar-based view of media assets
- Add advanced search features (date ranges, content types, etc.)

### Hardware Integrations
- Support for additional label printers
- Integration with hardware RAID systems
- Support for network storage (NAS) repositories

## 8. Maintenance and Long-term Planning

- Database migration strategy for schema updates
- Backup and restore procedures for the metadata database
- Monitoring of drive health over time
- Strategy for transferring the system to a permanent NUC solution
